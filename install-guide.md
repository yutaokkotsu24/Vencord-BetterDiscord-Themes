# INSTALL GUIDE!

download betterdiscord or vencord from the following links
https://vencord.dev
https://betterdiscord.app
DO NOT DOWNLOAD BOTH!

then once you have those installed, if discord is open restart it and you should have it installed.
go to settings and scroll on the left until you find "vencord" or "better discord" settings
go to themes and click on "Open Themes Folder"
Theme files end with .theme.css so those are the files you put into that folder that pops up.
then press "load missing themes" and if you did it correctly, you should see it. enable it and the theme will apply.
